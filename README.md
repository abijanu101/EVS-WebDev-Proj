# EVS-WebDev-Proj

This project is effectively just proof of my personal ability to do the basic tasks required of a MERN developer.
- Creating the serverside and the clientside
- Handling their interactions
- User Validation, etc.

Making this so I can get the CERT from EVS but I haven't really been putting much time into it because of uni - oh, well.
